#We are given three sides of a triangle.
#Triangle is equaliteral when all sides are the same.
# So in this code we have to display, when triangle is equale or false othervise

a = 9
b = 9
c = 10
is_equaliteral = a == b == c
#the calculation above is posible because python supports chained comparison operator.

print(is_equaliteral)
