#  Leap Year
# A year is leap if it is divisible by 4 but not by 100 
# unless it is also divisible by 400. 
# Write a program that takes a year as input 
# and prints True if it's a leap year, False otherwise.

year = int(input("enter the year you want to learn if it is a leap year:"))

# what conditions should this year give me so that I know it is a leap year
# I am looking for a year number that is divisible by 4 but not 100.
# Or it could be divisible by only 400 and it is a leap year

is_leap = year % 4 == 0 and year % 100 != 0 or year % 400 == 0

print("Is the given year leap?", is_leap)
#Note if the number x dividible by number z it means 
# x % z == 0 evaluates to True.
# if x % z == 0 is True it means x divisible by z.
