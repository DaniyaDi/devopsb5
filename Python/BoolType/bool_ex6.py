# Multiple of 3 and 5
# Write a program that takes a number as input and prints
# True if the number is a multiple of both three and five, False otherwise.
# Note: Multiple of 3 and 5 means it could be divisible by both 3 and 5. 

number = int(input("Enter a number:"))
# If a number is divisible by another number there shouldn't be a remainder.
is_divisible_3 = number % 3 == 0
is_divisible_5 = number % 5 == 0 

print(is_divisible_3 and is_divisible_5)
# result = number % 3 == 0 and number % 5 == 0
# print(result)
