# If statements in Python
- Purpose of an if statement is executing the certain parts of the code depending on the give 
boolean cinditions.
- When a boolean condition is True for the if statement the 
**next** block of code will be executed.

#### How do we know where next block of code starts and ends? 
- In python same block of codes has same indentation. So that, 
by looking at the indentation we could understand beginning and end of the block of codes.
**Note** a block of code refers to the lines of codes that belong to 
same implementations. This implementations could be `if statement` , methods , class etc.

#### How if statement works?
```py
if boolean_cond:
    #code belongs to if
    #code belongs to if
#code that is not effected by if statement, this line will always gets executed regardles of the if statement's condition.

```
**Note** As seen on the example above, only  if boolean condition is True if block will get executed.

## Examples:
```py
if True:
    #line1
    #line2
#line3

# Which of the lines above will be executed?
# Since the condition is True block of if statement (line1 and line2), 
# will get executed, Line 3 will never be effected by if statement so it will 
# always gets executed.
```

```py
if False:
    #line1
    #line2
#line3

## Since the condition is False code block of if statement (line1 and line2),
# will NOT get executed. Line 3 will never be effected by if statement so it will always gets executed.

```
