String Variables

How to create a str variable?
Everything that is defined within the quotes(single, double, triple),
Can be assigned to a variable as str value.

```py
s = "This is a string variable"
print(len(s)) # 25
```

Note! len() function will give us the total number of characters in string.

We can individually access the c–∞racters in string.

Accesing elements ins string
In order to access elements in string we should use their index numbers.

```py
#     123456   Lenght
#     012345   Index numbers
pl = "python"
# what is the index number for fourth letter in string?
# 3 
#Note: Last(biggest) index number will be one 
# less than length of the string.

```
