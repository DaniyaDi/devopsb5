Git Key Terms:

Repository:
It contains each files in your project and stores your changes as history
Think of it as a folder that Git can track (follow) the changes,
updates or deletes.

Local:
This refers to version of your project that is in your personal laptop.
When you make changes here, they are not immediately available to anyone else.
Changes need to be committed and pushed a remote Repository first.

Staging Environment:
    Before you commit all the changes , you can decide which changes 
    will be included in commit by moving changes to staging Environment.
    Staging are like is preparation table, where you can line up your changes,
    get ready for finalizing them.


COMMIT:
Once you're satisfied with changes you have made, then you can commit them.
A commit is like taking a picture of all the changes that you have made at the moment.


REMOTE REPOSITORY:
–ê version of your project that is on the internet or another network,
often in the platforms like github, Gitlab, Bitbucket.
After commiting changes locally, commits will be pushed to remote repo.

Basic commands of Git:
command is an order that we can execute in the terminal.

git init :
    This initialize a new git Repository and begins tracking an existing directory.
    Adds a hidden subfolder within the existing directory that houses
    the internal data structure required for version control.

git add:
    Adds changes in the directory(folder) to the staging area. It prepares it for the commit.
    syntax: git add filename

    git add git-day4.txt
    ```

    We would want to add all the changes in staging environment.
    ```

    git add -A
    ```

git commit:
    Takes all the changes written in staging environment and saves them to the 
    local Repository.
    You should provide a message describing what this commit is for.
    ```

    git commit -m "Descriptive commit message"

git push:
    Pushes commits from your local Repository to a remote Repository.
    For the first push to a new remote you might need to specify branch as well.

    First time:
    ```

    git push origin main
    ```
    All others:
    ```
    git push
    ```

What is token?
It is a string of characters that represents a specific permission or authorization.
In git we can use PAT(Personal Access Token): A secure token that users generate to authenticate into 
their github account when using HTTPS protocol.
