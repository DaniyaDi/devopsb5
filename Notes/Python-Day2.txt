A variable in programming is like 
a container where we can store the data

Why do we use variables?

1. Storage
    Variables allow us to store data that we can use and modify later.
2. Readability
    Makes our code easier to understand, debug and find what the data represents.
    * debug mostly means hoing over the code again for the purpose of understanding or finding mistake.
3. Reusability
    Once a value is stored in a variable, you can use that variable multiple times in a different parts
    of your code. 

Formula of the variable creation.
    variablename = value

Naming a Variable
    Rules:
        *Variable name cant start with a number .
        *It cant have spaces.
        *It can only contain alphanumeric characters and underscore(_).
            * alphanumeric: numbers and letters
        *Variable names are case sensitive, which means 'age' is not same as "Age'.

Naming Conventions
    * Convention --> how do you name the variable.

There are 4 different types of naming conventions:
    1. Camel Case 
        Naming starts with lower case and capitalizes each word after that.
        ex: firstName, lastName, areaCode etc.
        NOTE: Most of java, javascript users

    2. Pascal Case
        aming starts with upper case and capitalizes each word after that.
        ex: FirstName, LastName, AreaCode etc.

    3. Snake Case
        Each word in a variable name is separated by underscore
        ex: first_name, last_name, area_code etc.
        NOTE: Most of python users.

    4. Kebab Case
        Each word in a variable name is separated by hyphen (-)
        ex: first-name, last-name, area-code etc.

NOTE: when creating a variab;e type of variable is auto understood by python.

Type of numerical variables
    1. Integer : whole numbers
        ex: age = 25
    2. Float : Represents real numbers (Numbers with decimal points)
        ex: weight =190.4, avg = 8.0
    3. Complex : Represents complex numbers that has both imaginary and real parts.
        Ex: 5 + 4J --> 5 is the real part. 4J is imaginary part.



TYPE FUNCTION
    The type() function is a build-in Python function used to determine the data type of variable.
        wx: a = 10
            print(type(a)) # Output <class 'int'>
            b =10.1
            print(type(b)) #Output <class 'float'>

    Importance:
        Helps debugging
        Useful when learning because it helps you to understans how python works with data types.

Creating Multiple variables in a single line
    we can define multiple variables on a single line,
    by separating them with commas (,)
        Syntax: a,b,c =1.1, 1 , "h"
    Advantage: 
        Reduce line in your code
        More readable
        Compact code

Assingning Multiple Variables With a same value.
    Ex: a = b = c = d = 5
        #in the line above variable a, b, c and d will be assigned with a value 5 and type of all 
        #Variables will be integer. 

# PYTHON ALWAYS LOOKS FOR THE LAST ASIGNMENT TO THE line
# it is executing. you always look for the last change of the value. 

ReAssignment in Python  
    After variables assigned with a value, we can assign a new value to them.
    Ex: var1 = 6
        var1 = 10
